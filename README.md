# Projeto_PowerBI_Data_Area_Average_Salary_2024-
Another Power BI project I made from the scratch, to practice my skills in the BI tool.
The Power BI report shows salary averages grouped by company size (medium, large, small), with figures like $60 Mil and $80 Mil. It also covers salary averages by experience level, ranging from entry level to tech lead. There's a section for "Salary Average by Company Location," which includes a map. Overall, the report analyzes salary data for 2024 and presents it across categories like company size, experience level, job title, and location, with charts that likely offer interactive visuals for better analysis.

From the PDF, the title "Data Area Average Salary 2024" suggests it's a training Power BI report. One section, "Salary Average by Company Size," includes a bar chart comparing salary averages for different company sizes: small, medium, and large. Salary values range from $60 million to $200 million, with increments like $60 million, $80 million, and up to $200 million. This chart visually breaks down salaries by company size category.

The report seems to show that larger companies tend to pay more depending on the category.

Moving on, there’s a section called "Salary Average by Experience Level," where salary levels range from $0 million to $6 million. This likely includes bars for positions like Entry Level, Senior, Tech Lead, and Mid-Level.

There's also a "Salary Average by Company Location" section that uses a map, probably showing salary differences across different areas.

Finally, the "Salary Average by Job Title and Experience Level" section breaks down salaries for specific job titles like Data Scientist or ML Engineer, showing bar charts for each.

The report presents 2024 average salary data through Power BI. It shows how salaries vary based on company size, experience level, company location, and job title. The charts likely use data aggregation and visualizations to highlight these differences. I'll answer the user’s question in Portuguese:

"Este relatório de Power BI apresenta análises sobre o salário médio de profissionais para o ano 2024, dividido em várias dimensões, como tamanho da empresa, nível de experiência, localização da empresa e título do cargo."

The analysis highlights salary differences across company sizes (small, medium, large) and experience levels (entry, mid, senior, tech lead). It also shows a geographical salary distribution based on company location. Additionally, the report segments salaries by job title and experience level, helping in understanding which positions are paid better.

For example, the "Salary Average by Company Size" chart compares average salaries by company size, while the "Salary Average by Experience Level" chart shows how salary progresses with experience.
